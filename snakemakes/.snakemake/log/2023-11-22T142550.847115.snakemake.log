Removing output files of failed job create_bsgenome since they might be corrupted:
/dcs04/fertig/data/theron/splicemutr_snakemake_example/splicemutr_references/BSgenome.Hsapiens.GENCODE.GRCh38.p10
Skipped removing non-empty directory /dcs04/fertig/data/theron/splicemutr_snakemake_example/splicemutr_references/BSgenome.Hsapiens.GENCODE.GRCh38.p10
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
