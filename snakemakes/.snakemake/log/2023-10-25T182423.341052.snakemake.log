MissingOutputException in rule save_introns in file /users/tpalmer/splicemute/snakemakes/run_leafcutter.smk, line 87:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/dcs04/fertig/data/theron/splicemutr_snakemake_example/introns/CHOL_introns.rds
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
