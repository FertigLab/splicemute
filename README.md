SpliceMutr is a tool for evaluating how individual splice junctions affect coding transcripts from RNAseq data and whether those alterations produce peptides able to bind to the MHC complex.

The instructions that can be used to give examples of how the SpliceMutr pipeline scripts have been used for the analyis associated with the manuscript "Relating splicing-derived neoantigen burden to the tumor mutational burden, mutations in the splicing machinery, and inhibitor response with SpliceMutr" can be found in the folder "analysis" under the TCGA and CM038 headings and within the pipeline section. There is a jupyter notebook explaining usage of the appropriate scripts.
