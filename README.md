SpliceMutr is still a work in progress, but if you find it useful, please cite as follows:

Examples of how the SpliceMutr pipeline scripts have been used for the analyis associated with the manuscript "SpliceMutr enables pan-cancer analysis of splicing-derived neoantigen burden in tumors" can be found in the folder "analysis" under the TCGA and CM038 headings and within the pipeline section. There is a jupyter notebook explaining usage of the appropriate scripts.

The SpliceMutr package is under development and is still being made into a bioconductor-installable package.
